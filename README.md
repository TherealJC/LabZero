# LabZero
The What: Yesterday was the first day of the semester. I learned a lot about using git and vscode.  
The Why: This is an intro to coding and will help with current and future assignments.  
The How: I have been playing the Learning Git Branching game, and trying to learn all of the git commands that I can remember. I am playing around with a few different features of vscode and how they integrate with github.  
Things that I need to learn: When to use pull requests on github. I can make a branch, make changes, and then merge master to the branch, but I am not sure if the way that I am doing it is correct.
